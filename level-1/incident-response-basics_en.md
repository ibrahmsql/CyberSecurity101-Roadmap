## 1. Executive Summary

Incident Response is a systematic approach to detecting, analyzing, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents that occur in an organization. An effective incident response program minimizes the impact of security breaches, shortens recovery time, and increases the organization's resilience against future attacks. This section aims to establish a solid foundation by introducing the fundamental concepts, processes, and best practices of incident response.

## 2. Introduction: What is Incident Response?

Incident response is a structured approach used by an organization to manage events that violate or have the potential to violate information security policies. These events can range from malware infections to data breaches, from system outages to social engineering attacks.

### Why is it Important?

- **Damage Mitigation:** Minimizes the impact of security incidents and prevents their spread.
- **Rapid Recovery:** Shortens the time required for systems and services to return to normal operation.
- **Evidence Preservation:** Protects critical evidence for legal processes and forensic analysis.
- **Learning and Improvement:** Strengthens security posture by learning from each incident.
- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance:** Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS require incident reporting.
- **Reputation Protection:** Effective response preserves stakeholder confidence.
- **Cost Control:** Early intervention significantly reduces long-term costs.

### Scope of Incident Response

- **Proactive Preparation:** Incident response plans, procedures, and team training.
- **Detection and Analysis:** Identifying and evaluating security incidents.
- **Response and Eradication:** Neutralizing threats and cleaning them from systems.
- **Recovery:** Safely returning systems to normal operation.
- **Post-Incident Activities:** Learning lessons and improving processes.

## 3. Incident Response Lifecycle

According to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) SP 800-61 standard, the incident response lifecycle consists of four main phases:

```mermaid

### Prioritization Criteria

**Impact Level:**
- **High:** Critical system failure, major data loss, legal obligations.
- **Medium:** Important systems affected, limited data loss.
- **Low:** Minimal impact, single user affected.

**Urgency Level:**
- **Critical:** Immediate response required (0-1 hour).
- **High:** Rapid response required (1-4 hours).
- **Medium:** Normal response time (4-24 hours).
- **Low:** Standard response time (24-72 hours).

**Priority Matrix:**

| Impact \ Urgency | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|------------------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| **High**         | P2  | P1     | P1   | P1       |
