# 🔍 SIEM and Log Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary

### Topic Summary and Importance
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems are the heart of modern cybersecurity operations. These systems enable organizations to detect, analyze, and respond to security events in real-time. Log analysis is the process of examining system and network activity records to identify security threats and anomalies.

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding the architecture and operation of SIEM systems
- Identifying and managing log sources
- Detecting and analyzing security events
- Writing and optimizing SIEM rules
- Developing threat hunting techniques
- Managing SOC (Security Operations Center) operations

### Real World Application
- Enterprise security operations
- Compliance requirements (SOX, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
- Incident response processes
- Threat intelligence integration
- Forensic analysis support

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### Conceptual Explanation

#### What is SIEM?
SIEM is a security solution that collects, analyzes, and reports security information and events on a centralized platform. It consists of two main components:

1. **SIM (Security Information Management)**: Long-term log storage and analysis
2. **SEM (Security Event Management)**: Real-time event monitoring and alerting
