# Cloud Security Fundamentals

## 1. Executive Summary

### Topic Summary and Importance
Cloud security is one of the cornerstones of modern IT infrastructure. While 95% of organizations use cloud services, security concerns are still seen as the biggest obstacle. This module covers designing, implementing, and managing secure cloud architecture in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding cloud security models (Shared Responsibility Model)
- Developing multi-cloud security strategies
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices
- Using cloud native security tools
- Implementing compliance and governance frameworks
- Container and serverless security
- Security integration in DevSecOps pipelines

### Real World Application
- Enterprise cloud migration security planning
- Multi-cloud security posture management
- Zero-trust architecture implementation
- Cloud incident response and forensics
- Automated security compliance monitoring
